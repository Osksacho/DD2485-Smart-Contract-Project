# DD2485-Smart-Contract-Project
Concept: As a group of two, you scope, design, and implement a smart contract protocol. You choose a smart contract language of your choice. A DApp/UX is welcome but not mandatory. You present the protocol for 30 minutes (15 min presentation + 15 min questions) during the Smart Contract Grand Oral on December 18, 2023. 

The protocol proposal must be done through a pull-request before Nov 15, sunset in Stockholm.

|(BONUS) outreach: the students outreach to the crypto world about their protocol | Yes | No |
|(BONUS) real-world: the protocol is deployed on mainnet and IPFS | Yes | No |

## How to test

Start by cloning the repository and install all dependencies 

```
git clone git@github.com:Osksacho/DD2485-Smart-Contract-Project.git
npm install
```


Now you can start a local blockchain using
```
npx hardhat node
```

In another terminal you can now compile and deploy the contract with the command (use network-name "localhost" to deploy on local blockchain).
```
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [network-name]
```

## Run the website interface
There are a few extra steps here. First, to host the site locally you can go inte blockthoughts-site folder and
```
npm run dev
```

To correctly interact with the local blockchain you will need to have metamask installed in your browser and add your localhost as the blockchain network

You will also need to copy one of the private keys of an address generated by the local hardhat chain and create an account on metamask. This account will be given 10000 ETH by default.

Now you should be able to enter the site on http://127.0.0.1:5173/. Metamask will prompt you to allow access from the site.
